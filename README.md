## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

I tried to improve assesibility by using more landmark tags.  
I have more understanding of Sass varibles and CSS selectors.
I tried to use more descriptive classes.

```css
[class^="card_"] {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: start;
    height: 28em;
    width: 320px;
    padding: 1.5em 3em;
    // border: 1px dotted blue;
}
```

```scss
$font-family1: 'Big Shoulders Display', cursive;
$font-family2: 'Lexend Deca', sans-serif;
$bright_orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
$dark_cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
$very_dark_cyan: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
$transparent_white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
$very_light_gray: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
```

### Continued development

I hope to have a clearer understanding of best practices and gain as much knowledge as possible.

### Useful resources

- [CSS attrribute selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp) - This helped me see the logic behind selectors.
- [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#variables) - I am really enjoying Sass it makes everything so much cleaner.
